1. Python and Pip
Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or newer is recommended) installed on your system. Python comes with the package installer pip, which you'll use to install the necessary libraries.

python --version
pip --version

You need to install Flask (for the web application) and pandas (for data processing, including reading Excel files). Run this single command in your terminal:

pip install Flask pandas openpyxl

In command prompt: run <python app.py>
